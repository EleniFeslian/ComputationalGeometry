# ComputationalGeometry
The project created for the course Computational Geometry in University of Athens, involves implementing and analyzing four algorithms for finding the convex hull of points in the plane (Incremental Algorithm, Gift Wrapping, Divide and Conquer, QuickHull) and one algorithm for 3D space. It includes experimental application on point sets, comparison of execution times, analysis and graphical visualization of results.
